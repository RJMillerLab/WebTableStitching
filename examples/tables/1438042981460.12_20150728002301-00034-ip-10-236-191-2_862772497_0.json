The 2007 release by Destroyer Destroyer (no, that\u0027s not a typo), Littered with Arrows, is a smorgasbord of noise. The ultra young-looking Oklahoma City quintet has no time for melodicism; instead, it\u0027s all about non-stop screaming and start-stop riffing. And it was only a matter of time until a noise metal band adopted the \"Korn guitar trademark\" — the guitarists play detuned seven-string guitars. Not much variety here, but how many different shades of noise can one unleash out of their overdriven amplifiers? Take your pick of any of the album\u0027s 12 noise bombs, then run for cover and prepare of detonation. Top Albums and Songs by Destroyer Destroyer 1.
