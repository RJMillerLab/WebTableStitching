As they were recording a series of fine records, they turned out a number of classic singles that unquestionably defined their era. The Byrds\u0027 Greatest Hits does an excellent job of chronicling the peak years of their popularity before they went country-rock on 1968\u0027s Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Apart from the minor hits \"It Won\u0027t Be Wrong,\" \"Set You Free This Time,\" and \"Have You Seen Her Face,\" all of the group\u0027s hit singles — from 1965\u0027s \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" to 1967\u0027s \"My Back Pages\" — are included: \"All I Really Want to Do,\" \"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season),\" \"Eight Miles High,\" \"5D (Fifth Dimension),\" \"Mr. Spaceman,\" and \"So You Want to Be a Rock N\u0027 Roll Star.\" Yes, some great songs were left behind on the albums, but important cuts like \"I\u0027ll Feel a Whole Lot Better,\" \"The Bells of Rhymney,\" and \"Chimes of Freedom\" are added, making this pretty close to a definitive single-disc summary of the Byrds\u0027 prime.
