Bravo.           by guime5 I\u0027m celebrating the first anniversary of a life changing experience. Last year (I can’t recall if it was the 8th or 9th in february), I was at the TED conferences in Palm Springs, California. At the huge simulcast screen, a guy, strong as a football fullback, enters the stage in Long Beach. Accompanied just by his distressed tuxedo, a funny Beethovenesque hairdo and a rented Grand Steinway, Eric Lewis was introduced to the audience with no previous credentials, no mini-bio, no nothing. The guy sits at the piano. Thirty seconds of that kind of simple silence caused by no expectations whatsoever. What follows is a nuclear explosion of technique, energy, improvisation, strange faces, syncopation, originality and pure freedom. At the end of the performance we were in such collective awe, I can only remember having my hands numb from furious endless clapping. Eric Lewis was scheduled to play again on the following day, making an even greater impact into our ears and hearts. And for me this was when he was born. Of course he had a previous life: “he was a prodigy","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0},"mapping":{"URI":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/elew-rockjazz-vol-1/id356769934","tableName":"1438042981460.12_20150728002301-00005-ip-10-236-191-2_861399891_0.json","numHeaderRows":1,"mappedClass":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Single","second":1.0},"mappedProperties":{},"mappedInstances":{"1":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mr._Brightside","second":1.0},"2":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Diary_of_Jane","second":1.0},"4":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweet_Home_Alabama_(film)","second":1.0},"5":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","second":1.0},"7":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Going_Under_(2004_film)","second":1.0},"8":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smokers_Outside_the_Hospital_Doors","second":1.0},"10":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lights_and_Sounds_(song)","second":1.0},"11":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knives_Out","second":1.0},"13":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paint_It_Black_(novel)","second":1.0}},"keyIndex":1,"dataTypes":{"0":"numeric","1":"string","2":"string","3":"numeric","4":"numeric","5":"string"}}}
