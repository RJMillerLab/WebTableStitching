Cher is one of those artists who, like Diana Ross, seems to have countless greatest-hits collections, both in the U.S. and abroad. This set offers one previously unreleased song, \"Don\u0027t Come Cryin\u0027 to Me,\" written by Diane Warren, and the focus is mainly on the hits from her Geffen era, between 1987 and 1992. This album features her \u002780s comeback hit \"I Found Someone,\" the massive \"If I Could Turn Back Time,\" and her duet with Peter Cetera, \"After All.\" Other notables include her hit from the Mermaids soundtrack, \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It\u0027s in His Kiss)\" (which was a number one hit overseas), and the single remix of \"Heart of Stone.\" To touch on her \u002770s hits, this album includes her three signature \"story songs,\" \"Half-Breed,\" \"Dark Lady,\" and \"Gypsies, Tramps \u0026 Thieves,\" as well as two other Top Ten hits, 1972\u0027s \"The Way of Love\" and 1979\u0027s disco hit \"Take Me Home.\" For good measure, \"I Got You Babe\" closes out the album. This collection touches upon different eras of Cher\u0027s recording career, with emphasis on the Geffen years, but is by no means all-inclusive, and certainly doesn\u0027t touch on any","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0},"mapping":{"URI":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/if-i-could-turn-back-time/id106199","tableName":"1438042981460.12_20150728002301-00034-ip-10-236-191-2_862985729_0.json","numHeaderRows":1,"mappedClass":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Single","second":1.0},"mappedProperties":{"2":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/musicalArtist","second":0.10687281064827485}},"mappedInstances":{"1":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love_and_Understanding","second":0.933824098152964},"16":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Got_You_Babe","second":0.9254597586183904},"2":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Save_Up_All_Your_Tears","second":0.940706617513979},"3":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Shoop_Shoop_Song_(It\u0027s_in_His_Kiss)","second":0.9254597586183904},"5":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/If_I_Could_Turn_Back_Time","second":0.9254597586183904},"6":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Just_Like_Jesse_James","second":0.9254597586183904},"7":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart_of_Stone_(Bucks_Fizz_song)","second":0.9589171167566847},"8":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Found_Someone","second":0.9603754084150163},"9":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/We_All_Sleep_Alone","second":0.9420577448823098},"11":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Take_Me_Home_(Cher_song)","second":0.9589171167566847},"12":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dark_Lady_(song)","second":0.9589171167566847},"13":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Half-Breed_(song)","second":0.9589171167566847},"14":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Way_of_Love","second":0.9254597586183904}},"keyIndex":1,"dataTypes":{"0":"numeric","1":"string","2":"string","3":"numeric","4":"numeric","5":"string"}}}
