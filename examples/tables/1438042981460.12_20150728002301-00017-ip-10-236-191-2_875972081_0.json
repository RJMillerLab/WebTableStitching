Opening","textAfterTable":"82 Songs Album Review All eight of the albums Wes Montgomery issued on Verve in the mid-\u002760s (including the two he did with organist Jimmy Smith) are on this limited-edition, five-CD box set. With the addition of 20 bonus tracks (none previously unreleased, some of them alternate takes or overdubbed versions) and a 76-page booklet that includes readable reproductions of the original LP sleeves, it\u0027s the definitive compilation of his work for the label. By its very size, of course, its appeal might be limited to completists and serious collectors. But its no-stone-unturned thoroughness can\u0027t be faulted, and it sensitively separates the purest straight-ahead jazz material (all of the cuts recorded in 1965 for Smokin\u0027 at the Half Note) onto one CD, as well as placing the Montgomery-Smith albums so that they\u0027re heard in succession on the last half of disc four and the first half of disc five. Montgomery\u0027s Verve period is the source of some contention among critics and fans. Numerous jazz authorities are of the opinion that Wes by far did his finest work when he operated with standard, straight-ahead small jazz groups early in his recording career, and declined substantially when he moved to Verve, primarily owing to increasingly commercial material and orchestrated arrangements. Most listeners with some open-mindedness, however, will find at least some material","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0},"mapping":{"URI":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/movin-wes-pt.-2/id465087408?i\u003d465087421","tableName":"1438042981460.12_20150728002301-00017-ip-10-236-191-2_875972081_0.json","numHeaderRows":1,"mappedClass":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicalWork","second":1.0},"mappedProperties":{},"mappedInstances":{"68":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby,_It\u0027s_Cold_Outside_(album)","second":1.0},"1":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caravan_(Caravan_album)","second":1.0},"69":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_of_the_Road_(song)","second":1.0},"2":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/People,_People","second":1.0},"71":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/G.o.d.","second":1.0},"64":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Down_by_the_Riverside_(film)","second":1.0},"65":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Night_Train_(novel)","second":1.0},"8":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodora_(senatrix)","second":1.0},"77":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Big_Hurt_(film)","second":1.0},"9":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Out_and_In","second":1.0},"10":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Born_to_Be_Blue!_(Bobby_Timmons_album)","second":1.0},"79":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willow_Weep_for_Me_(album)","second":1.0},"11":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_Blues!","second":1.0},"72":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Call_Me_(Tweet_song)","second":1.0},"12":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bumpin\u0027_(Wes_Montgomery_album)","second":1.0},"13":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tear_It_Down_(album)","second":1.0},"74":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mellow_Mood","second":1.0},"15":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Con_Alma!","second":1.0},"75":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Round_Midnight_(soundtrack)","second":1.0},"16":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Shadow_of_Your_Smile_(Johnny_Mathis_album)","second":1.0},"18":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Here\u0027s_That_Rainy_Day","second":1.0},"21":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/You\u0027re_My_One_and_Only_Love","second":0.7142857142857143},"80":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait_of_Jennie_(novella)","second":1.0},"23":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/No_Blues","second":1.0},"82":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misty_(comics)","second":1.0},"25":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unit_7","second":1.0},"24":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/If_You_Could_See_Me_Now_(Cecelia_Ahern_novel)","second":1.0},"27":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/What\u0027s_New%3F_(album)","second":1.0},"29":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait_of_Jennie_(novella)","second":1.0},"28":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willow_Weep_for_Me_(album)","second":1.0},"30":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Surrey_with_the_Fringe_on_Top","second":1.0},"34":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goin\u0027_Out_of_My_Head_(album)","second":1.0},"32":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misty_(comics)","second":1.0},"42":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Golden_Earrings","second":1.0},"43":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tequila_(song)","second":1.0},"41":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/It_Was_a_Very_Good_Year","second":1.0},"46":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Big_Hurt_(film)","second":1.0},"44":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Little_Child","second":1.0},"45":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/What_the_World_Needs_Now_Is_Love_(album)","second":1.0},"51":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wives_and_Lovers_(film)","second":1.0},"49":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Thumb","second":1.0},"48":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/How_Insensitive_(album)","second":1.0},"53":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/California_Dreaming_(novel)","second":1.0},"52":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/TeQuila","second":1.0},"59":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunny_(singer)","second":1.0},"57":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Without_You_(The_Feeling_song)","second":1.0},"62":{"first":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_of_the_Border_(2009_film)","second":1.0}},"keyIndex":1,"dataTypes":{"0":"numeric","1":"string","2":"string","3":"numeric","4":"numeric","5":"string"}}}
